5/2/2025 16:39:13,Left,I am lefty.
5/2/2025 16:40:28,Left,
5/2/2025 16:45:33,Left,"If I turn my head to the right, I can say hi to all my fellow urinal users"
5/2/2025 16:46:01,Right Middle,not too close to the wall but far enough away from the door. ideal positioning
5/2/2025 16:49:06,Left,Bc it’s first
5/2/2025 16:50:44,Left,I’m assuming the entrance is on the right. This would make this urinal the most secluded
5/2/2025 16:51:47,Left,"It calls to me. Lean against the wall, hide as much as I can and anyone walking in won’t see me right away, because of the wall."
5/2/2025 16:52:07,Right,"It’s simply better. Leaves room for others, while asserting dominance over the other three choices."
5/2/2025 16:58:09,Right,just bc
5/2/2025 16:58:51,Left,
5/2/2025 17:02:08,Left,Wouldn’t go to middle in case others came in 
5/2/2025 17:02:49,Right,right is right
5/2/2025 17:03:45,Left,
5/2/2025 17:05:53,Right,just seems right 
5/2/2025 17:08:20,Left,Because if another person come in they can use the right one
5/2/2025 17:12:47,Left,Nice comfy corner
5/2/2025 17:30:30,Left,
5/2/2025 17:36:45,Right,Right is the right way.
5/2/2025 17:40:10,Left,bit more privacy and further away 
5/2/2025 17:45:25,Right,Gut feeling
5/2/2025 17:46:18,Left,I wouldn’t want anyone to see me pee
5/2/2025 17:50:25,Left,"cuz it’s the first one, in american culture we think of the left as first like reading left to right"
5/2/2025 18:24:54,Left,Furthest from danger 
5/2/2025 19:08:19,Right,Cause im a right person!!
5/2/2025 19:30:02,Left,"The left side of the bathroom is a calculated move. It maximizes situational awareness with a clear sight to the entrance, giving you early detection and reaction time to any unexpected presence. Your side is secured by the wall, eliminating a blind spot and reducing the risk of being approached from behind. Additionally, this spot tends to be farther from others, increasing personal space and minimizing distractions or potential confrontations. It’s about maintaining control, minimizing exposure, and operating from a position of tactical advantage."
